# React-GSAP-Playground

## Introduction
**React-GSAP-Playground** is a project designed to showcase the power and flexibility of GSAP in React applications. This playground contains multiple examples demonstrating various GSAP methods and plugins to create dynamic and interactive animations for web applications.

## Features
- Demonstrates the use of GSAP's core animation methods like `to`, `from`, `fromTo`, and `timeline`.
- Explores advanced GSAP features such as `stagger` and `ScrollTrigger`.
- Provides interactive examples for animating text, elements, and scroll-based animations.
- Modularized React components for easy navigation and reuse.
